-->An HTML attribute gives additional information to an HTML element and always goes in the elementâ€™s opening tag. An attribute is usually made up of two parts: a name, and a value; however, not all attributes require a value. 
In our case, we need to add a href (hyperlink reference) attribute to the opening anchor tag. 
The value of the href attribute is the destination we want our link to go to.

ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE LINKS

    Absolute Links
        -Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links.
        -A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts: protocol://domain/path
    
    Relative Links
        -Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on.

        <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>  -->  repending ./ before the link will in most cases prevent such issues. By adding ./ you are specifying to your code that it should start looking for the file/directory relative to the current directory.



IMAGES

Parent Directories
    --> To go to the parent directory we need to use two dots in the relative filepath like this: ../
