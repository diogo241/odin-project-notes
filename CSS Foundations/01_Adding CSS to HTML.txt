ADDING CSS TO HTML

    1--> External CSS
            External CSS is the most common method you will come across, and it involves creating a separate file for the CSS and linking it inside of an HTML’s opening and closing <head> tags with a self-closing <link> element.
            
            <!-- index.html -->
            <head>
                <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
            </head>

            /* styles.css */
            div {
                color: white;
                background-color: black;
            }
            p {
                color: red;
            }

                --> It keeps our HTML and CSS separated, which results in the HTML file being smaller and making things look cleaner.
                --> We only need to edit the CSS in one place, which is especially handy for websites with many pages that all share similar styles.


    2--> Internal CSS
            Internal CSS (or embedded CSS) involves adding the CSS within the HTML file itself instead of creating a completely separate file. 
            With the internal method, you place all the rules inside of a pair of opening and closing <style> tags, which are then placed inside of the opening and closing <head> tags of your HTML file. 
            Since the styles are being placed directly inside of the <head> tags, we no longer need a <link> element that the external method requires.

            <head>
                <style>
                    div {
                        color: white;
                        background-color: black;
                    }

                    p {
                        color: red;
                    }
                </style>
            </head>
            <body>...</body>


    3--> Inline CSS
            Inline CSS makes it possible to add styles directly to HTML elements, though this method isn’t as recommended.

            <body>
                <div style="color: white; background-color: black;">...</div>
            </body>
